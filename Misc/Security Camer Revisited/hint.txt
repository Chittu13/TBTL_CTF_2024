Due to last year's incident, our security team got transferred to a brand-new, cozy office.

The incident was successfully mitigated by placing the security camera so that it doesn't see the screen.

We believed our setup was completely secure, but hackers managed extract some sensitive data once again!

We inspected the security camera footage, but there's nothing there!
