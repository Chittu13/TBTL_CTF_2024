My Favorite Classmate
=====================

My favorite person in this class has a beautiful smile,
great sense of humour, and lots of colorful notebooks.

However, their most distinctive feature is the fact that
you can represent their name as an integer value, square
it modulo 59557942237937483757629838075432240015613811860811898821186897952866236010569299041278104165604573,
and you'll get 34994952631013563439857468985559745199379391295940238707110695903159545061311344766055629477728657.

Additionally, When you compute the greatest integer not exceeding
the cube root of their squared name, you get 7906488397402721714607879953738472269409876715324979164781592447.

By now, all of you have probably guessed who I'm talking about.
